# The ICON Network

ICON provides a couple of test environments, where you can deploy and test your SCORE without ICX. Below is the information about the networks that ICON foundation operates. When you send a transaction, make sure you use the correct **network id** \(nid\) in your transaction. If the network id does not match, the transaction will fail.

* [TestNet](testnet.md)
* [MainNet](mainnet.md)

Alternatively, you may want to have own private blockchain network for your development, or even for your commercial service. Below guidelines explain how to set up a private network with the same source code that the ICON mainnet is using.
