# Development Tools

### T-Bears Development Suite

Before you start writing a SCORE, you need to install the T-Bears. T-Bears provides the followings;

* Essential libraries for SCORE development, `iconservice`
* Local emulated node environment, `T-Bears Server`
* CLI commands for deploying a SCORE and invoking the SCORE functions, `T-Bears CLI`
* SCORE test framework

For the details of T-Bears, please go to [T-Bears Overview](doc:tbears-overview)

If you have finished the [SCORE Quickstart](doc:score-quickstart), you must have the T-Bears installed. If not, please refer to the T-Bears [Installation](doc:tbears-installation) instruction.

### IDE - PyCharm

Because SCORE is written in Python, any IDE that supports python can be used for the SCORE development. In this document, we will explain how to set up and initialize a SCORE project in PyCharm. We assume that you are familiar with Python development.

#### Install PyCharm CE, if you don't have it yet.

#### Create a Python project
